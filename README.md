## Task Manager

This project was created to gain hands-on experience with fundamental CRUD operations while working with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The goal was to strengthen my understanding of backend and frontend integration, data management, and the development of a full-stack application using modern JavaScript technologies.

## Functionality

This task manager application allows users to:
- Create tasks
- View current tasks
- Update task titles
- Delete tasks

The application uses MongoDB for database storage and Mongoose for handling database operations.

## How to Use:
1) Clone the repository to your local machine.
2) Navigate to the cloned repository directory.
3) Install dependencies and run the application:
4) Open a terminal in the client folder and run:
```npm run dev```
5) Open a terminal in the server folder and run:
```npm run dev```
6) Access the app by opening http://localhost:5173 in your browser, and start adding tasks!
